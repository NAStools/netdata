netdata (1.2.0) - 2016-05-16

 At a glance:

 - netdata is now 30% faster
 - netdata now has a registry (my-netdata dashboard menu)
 - netdata now monitors Linux Containers (docker, lxc, etc)

 IMPORTANT:
 This version requires libuuid. The package you need is:

  - uuid-dev (debian/ubuntu), or
  - libuuid-devel (centos/fedora/redhat)

 In detail:

 * netdata is now 30% faster !

   - Patches submitted by @fredericopissarra improved overall
     netdata performance by 10%.

   - A new improved search function in the internal indexes
     made all searches faster by 50%, resulting in about
     20% better performance for the core of netdata.

   - More efficient threads locking in key components
     contributed to the overal efficiency.

 * netdata now has a CENTRAL REGISTRY !

   The central registry tracks all your netdata servers
   and bookmarks them for you at the 'my-netdata' menu
   on all dashboards.

   Every netdata can act as a registry, but there is also
   a global registry provided for free for all netdata users!

 * netdata now monitors CONTAINERS !
   
   docker, lxc, or anything else. For each container it monitors
   CPU, RAM, DISK I/O (network interfaces were already monitored)

 * apps.plugin: now uses linux capabilities by default
   without setuid to root

 * netdata has now an improved signal handler
   thanks to @simonnagl

 * API: new improved CORS support

 * SNMP: counter64 support fixed

 * MYSQL: more charts, about QCache, MyISAM key cache,
   InnoDB buffer pools, open files

 * DISK charts now show mount point when available

 * Dashboard: improved support for older web browsers
   and mobile web browsers (thanks to @simonnagl)

 * Multi-server dashboards now allow de-coupled refreshes for
   each chart, so that if one netdata has a network latency
   the other charts are not affected

 * Several other minor improvements and bugfixes
