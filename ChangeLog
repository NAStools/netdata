 In detail:

 * improved alarms

   Many new alarms have been added to detect common kernel
   configuration errors and old alarms have been re-worked
   to avoid notification floods.

   Alarms now support notification hysteresis (both static
   and dynamic), notification self-cancellation, dynamic
   thresholds based on current alarm status

 * improved alarm notifications

   netdata now supports:

   - email notifications
   - slack.com notifications on slack channels
   - pushover.net notifications (mobile push notifications)
   - telegram.org notifications

   For all the above methods, netdata supports role-based
   notifications, with multiple recipients for each role
   and severity filtering per recipient!

   Also, netdata support HTML5 notifications, while the
   dashboard is open in a browser window (no need to be
   the active one).

   All notifications are now clickable to get to the chart
   that raised the alarm.

 * improved IoT support!

   netdata builds and runs with musl libc and runs on systems
   based on busybox.

 * improved containers support!

   netdata runs on alpine linux (a low profile linux distribution
   used in containers).

 * Dozens of other improvements and bugfixes
 
 
netdata (1.3.0) - 2016-08-28

 At a glance:

 - netdata has health monitoring / alarms!
 - netdata has badges that can be embeded anywhere!
 - netdata plugins are now written in Python!
 - new plugins: redis, memcached, nginx_log, ipfs, apache_cache

 IMPORTANT:
 Since netdata now uses Python plugins, new packages are

 In detail:

 * netdata has alarms!

   Based on the POLL we made on github
   (https://github.com/firehol/netdata/issues/436),
   health monitoring was the winner. So here it is!

   netdata now has a poweful health monitoring system embedded.
   Please check the wiki page:

 * netdata has badges!

   netdata can generate badges with live information from the
   collected metrics.

 * netdata plugins are now written in Python!

   Thanks to the great work of Pawe≈Ç Krupa (@paulfantom), most BASH
   plugins have been ported to Python.

   The new python.d.plugin supports both python2 and python3 and
   data collection from multiple sources for all modules.

   The following pre-existing modules have been ported to Python:

    - apache
    - cpufreq
    - example
    - exim
    - hddtemp
    - mysql
    - nginx
    - phpfm
    - postfix
    - sensors
    - squid
    - tomcat

   The following new modules have been added:

    - apache_cache
    - dovecot
    - ipfs
    - memcached
    - nginx_log
    - redis

 * other data collectors:

    - Thanks to @simonnagl netdata now reports disk space usage.

 * dashboards now transfer a certain settings from server to server
   when changing servers via the my-netdata menu.

   The settings transferred are the dashboard theme, the online
   help status and current pan and zoom timeframe of the dashboard.

 * API improvements:

   - reduction functions now support 'min', 'sum' and 'incremental-sum'.

   - netdata now offers a multi-threaded and a single threaded
     web server (single threaded is better for IoT).

 * apps.plugin improvements:

   - can now run with command line argument 'without-files'
     to prevent it from enumating all the open files/sockets/pipes
     of all running processes.

   - apps.plugin now scales the collected values to match the
     the total system usage.

   - apps.plugin can now report guest CPU usage per process.

   - repeating errors are now logged once per process.

 * netdata now runs with IDLE process priority (lower than nice 19)

 * netdata now instructs the kernel to kill it first when it starves
   for memory.

 * netdata listens for signals:

   - SIGHUP to netdata instructs it to re-open its log files
     (new logrotate files added too).

   - SIGUSR1 to netdata saves the database

   - SIGUSR2 to netdata reloads health / alarms configuration

 * netdata can now bind to multiple IPs and ports.

 * netdata now has new systemd service file (it starts as user
   netdata and does not fork).

netdata (1.2.0) - 2016-05-16

 At a glance:

 - netdata is now 30% faster
 - netdata now has a registry (my-netdata dashboard menu)
 - netdata now monitors Linux Containers (docker, lxc, etc)

 IMPORTANT:
 This version requires libuuid. The package you need is:

  - uuid-dev (debian/ubuntu), or
  - libuuid-devel (centos/fedora/redhat)

 In detail:

 * netdata is now 30% faster !

   - Patches submitted by @fredericopissarra improved overall
     netdata performance by 10%.

   - A new improved search function in the internal indexes
     made all searches faster by 50%, resulting in about
     20% better performance for the core of netdata.

   - More efficient threads locking in key components
     contributed to the overal efficiency.

 * netdata now has a CENTRAL REGISTRY !

   The central registry tracks all your netdata servers
   and bookmarks them for you at the 'my-netdata' menu
   on all dashboards.

   Every netdata can act as a registry, but there is also
   a global registry provided for free for all netdata users!

 * netdata now monitors CONTAINERS !
   
   docker, lxc, or anything else. For each container it monitors
   CPU, RAM, DISK I/O (network interfaces were already monitored)

 * apps.plugin: now uses linux capabilities by default
   without setuid to root

 * netdata has now an improved signal handler
   thanks to @simonnagl

 * API: new improved CORS support

 * SNMP: counter64 support fixed

 * MYSQL: more charts, about QCache, MyISAM key cache,
   InnoDB buffer pools, open files

 * DISK charts now show mount point when available

 * Dashboard: improved support for older web browsers
   and mobile web browsers (thanks to @simonnagl)

 * Multi-server dashboards now allow de-coupled refreshes for
   each chart, so that if one netdata has a network latency
   the other charts are not affected

 * Several other minor improvements and bugfixes
