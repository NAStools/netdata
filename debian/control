Description: Highly optimized daemon providing real-time performance monitoring
 netdata is a highly optimized Linux daemon providing real-time performance
 monitoring for Linux systems, Applications, SNMP devices, over the web!
 It tries to visualize the truth of now, in its greatest detail, so that you
 can get insights of what is happening now and what just happened, on your
 systems and applications.
 This is what you get:
 Stunning bootstrap dashboards, out of the box (themable: dark, light)
 Blazingly fast and super efficient, mostly written in C (for default
 installations, expect just 2% of a single core CPU usage and a few MB of RAM)
 Zero configuration - you just install it and it autodetects everything
 Zero dependencies, it is its own web server for its static web files and its
 web API
 Zero maintenance, you just run it, it does the rest
 Custom dashboards that can be built using simple HTML (no javascript necessary)
 Extensible, you can monitor anything you can get a metric for, using its
 Plugin API (anything can be a netdata plugin - from BASH to node.js, so you
 can easily monitor any application, any API)
 Embeddable, it can run anywhere a Linux kernel runs and its charts can be
 embedded on your web pages too
